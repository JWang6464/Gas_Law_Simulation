# Gas_Law_Simulation
A Python-based Ideal Gas Law simulation that models gas particle behavior in a closed system. Features modules for particle collisions, graphical visualization, and data analysis. Includes core files like collision.py, graphicsPlus.py, objects.py, and idealgaslawsimulation.py.


This repository contains a Python-based simulation of the Ideal Gas Law. The simulation models the behavior of gas particles in a closed system using object-oriented programming. It includes modules for handling particle collisions, graphical visualization, and data analysis. The project showcases the relationship between pressure, volume, and temperature, adhering to the principles of the Ideal Gas Law (PV = nRT).

Features:

Collision.py: Handles particle collisions and interactions between gas particles.
GraphicsPlus.py: Provides graphical functions for visualizing the gas particles in motion.
Idealgaslawsimulation.py: The main script that brings together the components to run the simulation.
Objects.py: Defines objects such as particles and their properties.
Data.csv: Contains sample data for the simulation.
Technologies used: Python, OOP, CSV for data handling, and custom graphical libraries for visualization.

This project demonstrates core programming skills, including object-oriented programming, file I/O, and graphical rendering. It's a great project to understand physics simulation and visualize how gas laws operate at a particle level.
